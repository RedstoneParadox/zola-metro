# Metro
{% end %}

Metro is a website theme for the Zola static site generator with a clean and modern look. It was inspired by Duckquill and Abridge, though definitely has a distinct feel from both of them. It was originally developed as my personal website before I decided to spin it off into its own
thing for other people to use.

## Features

- Designed to look good on both desktop and mobile devices
- Builtin lightmode/darkmode handling button
- Ability for taxonomy pages to reference other taxonomies
- Slideshow-style media gallery web component available via shortcode
- Shortcodes for text formatting, columns, etc.
- No JS mode that removes all JS features.

## Credits

- [Duckquill](https://codeberg.org/daudix/duckquill): Navbutton, tag button, and social button CSS code.
- [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/): Used as part of the site.
- [Charm Icons](https://github.com/jaynewey/charm-icons); Clock and pencil icons
