# Metro
{% end %}

Metro is a website theme for the Zola static site generator with a clean and modern look. It was inspired by Duckquill and Abridge, though definitely has a distinct feel from both of them. It was originally developed as my personal website before I decided to spin it off into its own
thing for other people to use.

Some features include:
- Builtin lightmode/darkmode button

## Credits

- [Duckquill](https://codeberg.org/daudix/duckquill) for navbutton, tag button, and social button CSS code.
- [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/); used as part of the site.
