# Metro
{% end %}

Metro is a website theme for the Zola static site generator with a clean and modern look. It was inspired by Duckquill and Abridge, though definitely has a distinct feel from both of them. It was originally developed as my personal website before I decided to spin it off into its own
thing for other people to use.

At the moment, this theme is still a heavy work in progress. Feedback and contributions are welcome at the GitHub repository.

## Features

Implemented:
- Designed to look good on both desktop and mobile devices
- Optional lightmode/darkmode button
- Shortcode for text alignment

Planned:
- Image galleries (carousel and static)
- Support for non-post style pages

## Credits

- [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/): Partially adapted to use with the theme
