So, I have a blog now. That's it, that's the point of this post. It's kind of weird to think that 7 years ago, I had only just started programming in Java to make Minecraft mods - having first attempted to make them in MCreator but almost immediately hitting its limitations - and now I've learned how to use Docker and re-learned HTML and CSS to create my own website with a blog. I could talk about my journey here, but that's for a future blog post.

As to what I'll use this blog for? Well, I don't quite know yet. For now, it's mostly going to be devlogs for my Minecraft mods, but I might post all sorts of long-form content here as well. Maybe I'll branch out to other things, like general programming discussions, tutorials (I'll probably do one for setting up a website with a maven using docker like I did), and maybe game reviews. Nothing's set in stone yet.

Those of you who have been here before this post might also notice that I redesigned my website as well. After receiving some feedback, I made changes to the header and footer, made the design language more consistent, and cleaned up the overall design of the website, all which I am quite proud of. I'm also making the source code visible, which you can find <a class="extern" href="https://github.com/RedstoneParadox/redstoneparadox.xyz">here</a>.

Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this; if you want to be alerted to future posts, you can subscribe to my atom feed below.
